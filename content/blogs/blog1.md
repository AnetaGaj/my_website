title: Horse riding - dressage 
---

Horse riding is one of the biggest parts of my life. I started training when I was very young, and almost immediately moved my focus to dressage. To become one of the best juniors in my country, I had to work extremely hard and devote fully to this sport. I learned a lot through these difficult and amazing years with my horse and coach. We spent every day on training and practice, since everything you do is based on cooperation between the rider and the horse. Building a strong bond takes time and effort, but for me, it is the most magical part of this sport. Taking care of such a large and fragile animal requires responsibility and involvement. Even though my professional career ended, I still enjoy recreational horse riding now and then.
